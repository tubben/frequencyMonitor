We developed an embedded microcontroller application that will monitor the power systems frequency, and take actions based on those measurements. 
This application will have an LFC (Load-frequency control) block. 
A Zero-cross-detection function is presented to calculate the frequency based on the period. An Arduino and LCD function is presented. Lastly, 
a Vrms function is presented that will sample the ADC values to compute the calculations.
To complete the application, an Arduino MKR1010, an LCD screen, and the Arduino cloud has been used.
